Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects (Ref: Wikipedia). I have done several Python projects and worked on topics like machine learning, deep learning, etc. where I successfully worked with a ton of Python codes. Despite having a good understanding of Python codes, I always kinda felt like I need to brush up on my basics of Python again. In order to overcome that insecurity, I finally started to brush up on my Python basics again. This time I will be learning from my go-to instructor Corey Schafer. I will also like to cover FreeCodeCamps' tutorial on Python OOP as well. This repository contains basic Python syntaxes as well as an understanding of Python as an object-oriented programming language.
